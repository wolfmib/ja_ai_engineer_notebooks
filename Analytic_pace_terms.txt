PACE workflow: A framework that provides an initial structure to guide the process of data analytics; PACE stands for plan, analyze, construct, and execute

Plan stage: Stage of the PACE workflow where the scope of a project is defined and the informational needs of the organization are identified

Analyze stage: Stage of the PACE workflow where the necessary data is acquired from primary and secondary sources and then cleaned, reorganized, and analyzed

Construct stage: Stage of the PACE workflow where data models and machine learning algorithms are built, interpreted, and revised to uncover relationships within the data and help unlock insights from those relationships

Execute stage: Stage of the PACE workflow where a data professional will present findings with internal and external stakeholders, answer questions, consider different viewpoints, and make recommendations
