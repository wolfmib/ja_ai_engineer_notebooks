# DataAnalytic_CLT_LiteracyRate_Explain

### Overview  
This notebook demonstrates the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** using a real-world example — estimating a nation’s literacy rate from sample data.  
It shows how increasing the sample size improves the accuracy of the sample mean and how this principle supports **data-driven policy decisions** in education and development planning.

### Key Learning Points  
- Understand the concept of the **Central Limit Theorem**.  
- Observe how **sample size** affects the accuracy of the mean estimate.  
- Apply CLT to a **literacy rate dataset** to compare sample estimates with the population mean.  
- Use **Python sampling and visualization** to illustrate the convergence to a normal distribution.  
- Interpret the statistical findings for **real-world decision-making** (e.g., resource allocation for education improvement).
