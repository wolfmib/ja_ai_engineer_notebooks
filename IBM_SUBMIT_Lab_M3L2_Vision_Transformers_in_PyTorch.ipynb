    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn to build a PyTorch-based hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. \n",
    "You'll start by using CNN layers to extract detailed features, such as edges and textures, from images. Then, you'll see how those features are passed to a Vision Transformer, which looks at the global correlations in the entire image by looking at all locations at once. Then, you will train a hybrid CNN-ViT model, and by the end of this lab, you'll also know how to monitor its performance. This approach gives you practical experience with state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision!\n"

This stabilizes training of these very deep, stackable models, improves convergence speed, and lets them scale to larger datasets and more complex tasks.\n",
