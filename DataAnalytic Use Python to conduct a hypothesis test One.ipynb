STATE28 has almost 40 districts, and STATE21 has more than 70. Due to limited time and resources, you are only able to survey 20 randomly chosen districts in each state. The department asks you to determine if the difference between the two mean district literacy rates is statistically significant or due to chance. This will help the department decide how to distribute government funding to improve literacy. If there is a statistically-significant difference, the state with the lower literacy rate may receive more funding. \n",
