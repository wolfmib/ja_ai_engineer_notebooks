The value of the PACE strategy document
You have learned about the PACE workflow and how it helps bring structure to the data analytical process. This reading introduces the PACE strategy document. It is a resource designed to assist you in this program and throughout your career as a data analytics professional.

Why do I need the PACE strategy document?
The videos, readings, activities, and projects in this program are a foundation for advancing your data skills and knowledge. But, success in the data career space involves more than data analytical skills. Data professionals are often involved in organizational decision making. This requires them to communicate about data and the results of data analysis with a variety of stakeholders.

In the advanced data analysis program, you’ll be introduced to different aspects of the field, which data analytics professionals encounter. Concepts and skills are arranged in a logical order and organized into courses that will prepare you for more advanced analytical tasks. 

After each course, you'll be asked to develop an end-of-course project that demonstrates your mastery of expected data professional skills, such as your analytical and communication skills. To assist, you will receive an individual PACE strategy document for each of the course projects. Inside the PACE strategy documents, you’ll find helpful tips and opportunities to reflect on what you have learned and consider how to apply it to your job as a data analytics professional. Additionally, your responses within these strategy documents will help you create executive summaries that will inform decision makers and stakeholders of a project’s progress.

PACE strategy documents provide evidence of your expanded knowledge and can serve as a powerful motivator when acquiring new skills. Commitment to an educational program requires dedication and persistence. Your knowledge base and technical proficiency will be expanded through this journey. The gradual nature of personal growth makes it difficult to monitor day-to-day progress. Each PACE strategy document is designed to function as a record of your progress while developing new data analytical skills. The strategy documents will also help you improve communication skills by providing thoughtful questions designed to help identify and detail each step of your data analysis.
