# DataAnalytic_Sampling_AQI_Explain

### Overview  
This notebook explores **sampling techniques and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data on **carbon monoxide Air Quality Index (AQI)** readings.  
You’ll practice drawing random samples, constructing sampling distributions, and interpreting the relationship between **sample means** and the **population mean**.

### Key Learning Points  
- Understand **sampling variability** and why sample means differ from population means.  
- Perform **sampling with replacement** to create multiple random samples.  
- Generate a **sampling distribution** from 10,000 resamples of AQI data.  
- Visualize and confirm that the **distribution of sample means** approximates normality per the CLT.  
- Translate analytical findings into **environmental and policy insights**.

### Key Insights  
- Sample means vary naturally — this is called **sampling variability**.  
- The **Central Limit Theorem** ensures that the sampling distribution of the mean becomes normal with enough samples.  
- The **mean of sample means** approximates the **population mean**, validating the reliability of large-sample inference.  
- AQI values around or below 100 are typically satisfactory; regions above this threshold warrant further investigation.

### Files Included  
- `README.md` – Project overview and learning objectives.  
- `Sampling_AQI.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook demonstrating the sampling experiment.
